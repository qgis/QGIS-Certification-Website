<p>
  On the registration page you can fill in all the key details about your
  organisation including its, address (physical and online), contact person
  email, logo and so on. It is important to include a logo if you have one as
  that will be used on the certificates issued by the system. We recommend that
  you use a logo with a square aspect ratio for this.
