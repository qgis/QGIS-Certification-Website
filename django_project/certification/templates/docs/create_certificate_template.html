<h1 class="title">Creating a certificate template</h1>
<p>
  You can create your own custom templates for the certificates that you issue.
  In this workflow we use the Gimp to open one of the generated certificate
  PDF's from your course.
</p>

/>

<p>
  Next decorate around the pre-planned text from the certificate. We don't have
  a templating language so you cannot move the pre-defined elements currently.
</p>
<img

/>

<p>
  Once your template is prepared, you hide again the original certificate layer
  and export your gimp document as a PNG image.
</p>

/>
<p>
  Now upload the image to the course edit page and test your template by adding
  one course participant and using the ‘Print Certificate’ icon to preview it.
</p>
