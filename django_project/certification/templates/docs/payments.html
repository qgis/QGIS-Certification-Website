<p>
  We are planning to introduce an e-commerce system soon. When that is
  implemented, you will be able to purchase credits which can be used to then
  pay for the certificates you issue. Currently we work on a somewhat manual
  system - when you are going to be running a course, ask one of the project
  administrators to load credits for your organisation. Then add attendees to
  your course (you can do this individually or in buld by providing a CSV file).
