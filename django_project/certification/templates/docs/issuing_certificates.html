<h1 class="title">Issuing certificates</h1>
<p>
  We are planning to introduce an e-commerce system soon. When that is
  implemented, you will be able to purchase credits which can be used to then
  pay for the certificates you issue. Currently we work on a somewhat manual
  system - when you are going to be running a course, ask one of the project
  administrators to load credits for your organisation. Then add attendees to
  your course (you can do this individually or in bulk by providing a CSV file).
  Once you have issued certificates for each attendee you can issue
  certificates. The process of registering an attendee and issuing the
  certificate is separated so you need only issue certificate to those that pass
  your course. Each attendee will receive an email with a link to a downloadable
  copy of the certificate. The certificate includes a unique number which is
  allocated to each certificate and a unique link that they can provide (for
  example in their CV) to verify that they have indeed completed the course.
  This mechanism should help to prevent fake certificates. Course conveners
  should upload a digital signature to their profile. This is embedded into the
  certificate together with the digital signature of the project leader (who
  needs to set this in the project profile options page).
