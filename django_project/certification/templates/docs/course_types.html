<h1 class="title">Course types</h1>
<p>
  Course types describe the different content offering you offer. You can
  include how many hours of instruction that are included in the course. If you
  do this, this information will be included on the certificate when it is
  generated. Probably you will define your course types around topics (e.g.
  working with databases) or around skill leve (beginner, intermediate etc.).
