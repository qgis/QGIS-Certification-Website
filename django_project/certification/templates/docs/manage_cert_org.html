<h1 class="title">Managing your certifying organisation</h1>

<p>
  Once the organisation is approved, you will receive a confirmation email and
  the organisation can be managed from the project certication menu. Your new
  project will look something like this:
</p>
<img
  src="{% static "images/docs/manage-org.gif" %}"
/>
<p>
  The top of your organisation page gives a quick dashboard overview of your
  organisation, credits, training centers and attendees. The map will be zoomed
  in to the region where your organisation operates. There are then four main
  things that can be managed:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Courses</li>
  <li>Training Centers</li>
  <li>Course Types</li>
  <li>Course conveners</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Typically you will first create Training Centers, Course conveners, Course
  types and then create courses.
