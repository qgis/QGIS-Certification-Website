<h1 class="title">Certification programme overview</h1>
<p>
  The QGIS certification platform is designed to provide an easy path for
  projects to be able to issue certification certificates. The system allows a
  project to approve one or more certification providers. These providers can
  then set up training centers and course conveners. Course conveners prepare a
  course and then attendees are assigned to that course. Once the course is
  completed, certificates get issued by the course convener in digital form.
  There is the opportunity to charge a fee for each certificate issued. This
  mechanism can be used to support the parent project.

  The following diagram provides a generalised overview of the certification
  process from the point of view of a certifying organisation.

  You may be wondering about our approach to certification. We looked at a
  number of approaches where we could provide a more rigorous and systematic way
  of certifying software users. These approaches can be split in two general
  approaches:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Computer based testing: Favoured by industry, in this approach the project
    owner would create a large pool of questions and then provide a test
    environment where a random subset of questions are allocated to the person
    being tested and they would carry out an online examination. There are a few
    issues with this approach including the need for a way to verify that the
    correct user actually undertook the exam and not a proxy, the need for a
    large amount of project input to create and maintain the test questions, and
    the general trend for examinees to go online and share the questions the
    were asked for future examinees. There is also the issue that sometimes
    complex (especially graphical) software is hard to examine in an environment
    where text based answers are expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Portfolio based testing: Favoured by academia, this approach requires
    attendees to submit mini-projects or other projects such as maps and reports
    to demonstrate their competency. This has a downside that each evaluation is
    very personal and subjective.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Neither of these systems is really suitable for our needs so we have opted for
  a third choice: In this approach we create a "web of trust". In this approach
  we trust the organisations that provide training to properly issue
  certificates for their course attendees. We spend our time verifying the
  certifying organisation and then trust them to 'do the right thing' after
  that.
