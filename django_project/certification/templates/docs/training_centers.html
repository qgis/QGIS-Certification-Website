<h1 class="title">Training centers</h1>
<p>
  A training center is a venue where you regularly conduct courses. Each
  organisation may have one or more training centers. If you are doing onsite or
  'roaming' training, I suggest to either make a training center per location
  where you offer training, or create a single location (e.g. at your offices)
  that you can use as a proxy for other venues.

  In the future we will provide a map with pins showing where upcoming training
  courses will be provided for all Certification organisations.
