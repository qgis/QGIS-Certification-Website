<h1 class="title">Approval process for certifying organisations</h1>
<p>
  The approval process is largely a norm established in your project. One
  approach that can be taken is to approve 'known' organisations associated with
  the project based on your knowledge of the organisation's skills and
  competencies. For organisations that are not known to the project, a more
  rigorous process can be followed whereby moderators review the applicant
  certifying organisation's web site, ask to review their training course
  curricula, the training materials used by the organisation, or possibly even
  sit in on a training course conducted by the applicant to verify that they
  "know their stuff". Once the organisation has passed approval, the
  organisation owner and mangers will be able to proceed with setting up
  courses, conveners and so on using the management interface provided on
  the QGIS Certification Website.
