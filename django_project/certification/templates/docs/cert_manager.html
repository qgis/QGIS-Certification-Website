<h1 class="title">Certification managers</h1>
<p>
  Setting up the certification programme for your project starts with the
  creation of one or more certification managers in your project. Certification
  managers are moderators for the certification programme in your project. Only
  a project administrator can update the list of certification managers. The
  project owner and certification managers can then manage which users can
  approve and manage the list of certifying organisations. Whenever a new
  certifying organisation is registered, the project certification managers will
  receive a notification by email that there is a new organisation ready for
  review and approval. You can manage the list of certication managers for a
  project by clicking on the project edit button and then scrolling down until
  you find the certification managers list. Add and remove members from the list
  as needed and then save your project.
